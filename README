This application was designed to be run on OpenShift (www.openshift.com). It is
based on the Flask example from OpenShift on GitHub:
  https://github.com/openshift/flask-example

Set up an OpenShift application with the wsgi and mongodb cartridges. You will
want to move wsgi/config_default.py to wsgi/config.py, then change SECRET_KEY
and FUDCON_*. Then the application should Just Work(tm).
